              My name is Jenny and I am a front-end developer. I always have had an interest in computers and websites and after
            coming to a crossroad I decided to take the path that was completely new. I attended a women in tech conference that allowed me to meet and hear
          from various women all in different stages of their tech careers. After this conference I was inspired to dive in head first into the tech world!
         </p>
            <p>I have found my interest in html, css, and javascript. I have also spent some time working in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. Being able to create a functioning web application for users to enjoy is very rewarding. 
              I am a hard workers and am always curious to learn about new things and how to implement them. The idea that technology is constanly changing
              and growing drew me to the industry. </p>
